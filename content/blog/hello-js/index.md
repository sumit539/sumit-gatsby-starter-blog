This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

I am a core java developer. But this year I have decided to become a fullstack developer.
So, the first thing I want to learn is vanilla JS. I am trying to create a calculator using
plane JS. 

So the target for the completion of the project is 22nd of March. Once, I will complete the project
I will share the github url here on my blog.
